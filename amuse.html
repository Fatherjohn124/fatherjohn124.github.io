  <h1>Amuse Me</h1> 
  <h2>You never know who you might meet at comedy shows</h2>
  <p>When I was in highschool, I used to watch a ton of comedy videos and specials staying up late at night wacthing guys like Joey Diaz, Dave chappelle, etc. One comedian I watched a ton later in highschool was Austin Schultz as he has great crowd interactions that become very viral. This one interaction is one of my favorties and best ones he has had all time.</p>

  <h2>The start of South Park</h2>
  <p>South Park is one of my favorite tv shows of all time and has a ton of classic episodes that never fail to make me laugh. This epidsode though is one of the first pliot episodes South Park made, coming a long way from what they used to be.</p>

  <h2>Why 40 year olds don't dunk</h2>
