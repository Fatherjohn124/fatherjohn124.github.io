        <p>I enjoy doing a lot of different things on a daily basis but recently I've noticed three things that I have really enjoyed doing. The first thing is trying to better and get stronger with my faith and religion as my faith and beleifs have helped me a lot throughout in life. The second thing is baseball as I watch, play and coach a lot of baseball so i'm constantly around doing that. The final thing I really enjoy doing is being active and going outside as it helps me get away from everything that is going on in life and helps me find peace.</p>
